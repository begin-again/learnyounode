## First I/O

Write a program that uses a single synchronous filesystem operation to
read a file and print the number of newlines(\n) it contains to the
console(stdout), similar to running `cat file | wc - l`.

The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first
command - line argument(i.e., `process.argv[2]`).You do not need to make
your own test file.

## HINTS

To perform a filesystem operation you are going to need the fs module from the Node core library. To load this kind of module, or any other "global" module, use the following incantation:

`var fs = require('fs')`
