# Learn you node

Node tutorial from [Node School](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)

## Usage

### Shortcuts

Because learnyounode is installed locally, one has to either use yarn or reference the binary in node_modules. It's easier to use yarn, imo.

*   `yarn current`, show current challenge
*   `yarn lhelp`, show help
*   `yarn lrun <js file>`, run you solution with some test inputs
*   `yarn next`, move to next challenge
*   `yarn print`, show current challenge
*   `yarn reset`, clear current progress
*   `yarn start`, start a new session
*   `yarn verify <js file>`, check your solution

### Practice

*   Create a new branch for each attempt.
*   Practice without looking at internet or previous attempts
